# folly-shell (fosh)

## what is it ?

* a shell to access system (unix based, running a bourne shell or compatible).
* runs as a browser "app" or "extesion" for socket access
* or in a standard browser page using a websockets proxy
* works over ssh using code from [firessh](https://github.com/mimecuvalo/firessh)

## why?

Because in the second decade of the 21st century, we can do a little better than accessing remotes systems
by pretending to be sitting at mono-colour glass teletype terminals.

Heres just one example: when I want to edit a text file on a remote system, why should I be limited to using the 
installed text editors on the remote system? In fact why do I need to be limited to using the shells installed on
the remote system and wait for the network latency for each character UI type to be echoed back to me?

And no I don't mean "mounting" the remote filesystem and pretending its a local filesystem, that kind of slight pf
hand just leads to frustration.

I'm talking about something just a little better and more civilised.
